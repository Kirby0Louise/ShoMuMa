# ShoMuMa
Open format standard for a new generation of visual novels


### Goals of the Project
- Create an open format standard for a new generation of visual novels
- Create a format allowing for a move away from VNs distributed as their own executable & engine to just the required data package
- Create a format that is cabaple of supporting as many features of VNs as possible
- Create a format that is flexible and unrestricted in how the author can implement these features
- Create a format that keeps the VN easily organized as this is important for larger projects
- Create a format that is specifically **NOT** inherently backwards or forwards compatible
- Create a format that is not computationally expensive for an engine to interpret, specifically with ARM based mobile devices running the VN off SD/eMMC in mind

### FAQ

Q - Why would you want ShoMuMa to specifically **NOT** be backwards or forwards compatible?

A - By placing the requirement of backwards/forwards compatibility on the engine devs, it ensures that the standard never becomes a cause of incompatibility of an engine.  In other words, if something doesn't work, then either the engine is programmed incorrectly or the VN data is corrupt

Q - Explain the name

A - Goblins and the Spring Breeze Concerto, Dream Demon's Spinning Fantasy of the Night Wind, The Lost Child and Thousands of Symphonies
